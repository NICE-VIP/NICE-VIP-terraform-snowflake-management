# NICE-VIP-terraform-snowflake-management
This repository provides Terraform configurations and modules for managing Snowflake infrastructure. It includes templates for provisioning, configuring, and automating Snowflake resources such as databases, schemas, and warehouses, ensuring seamless and scalable data management in the cloud.

## Why did we choose Terraform over other IaC tools??
There were a couple of reasons. The first was that Snowflake-Labs itself maintains the Terraform plugin for Snowflake, enabling quicker support for new features. Terraform also has the largest community out of all other IaC tools and has a detailed documentation. The Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL), used by Terraform, provides a great way to describe and write cloud infrastructure.
